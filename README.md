## PROJECT: CC-CC to OpenBridge Translator ##

**NOTICE:** CC-CC is not a published, open protocol. Support for it here is
derived from interoperability analysis against a production c-Bridge, not
from vendor documentation (see `CC-CC_Link_Protocol_Specification.md`).
Several details remain undefined or assumed (see that document's §13); please
do not ask for features that require further reverse-engineering without
providing verified, legally obtained information about the protocol.

**PURPOSE:** A single, small native daemon that bridges c-Bridge **CC-CC**
links to **OpenBridge** peers — HBlink3, HBlink4, or any other product that
speaks OpenBridge. `cc2obp` is the server-tier counterpart to
[`ipsc2hbpc`](https://github.com/n0mjs710/ipsc2hbpc): where `ipsc2hbpc`
bridges one IPSC repeater system to one HomeBrew network, `cc2obp` bridges
any number of CC-CC links to any number of OpenBridge peers, one CC-CC link
to exactly one OpenBridge `(system, TGID)` at a time.

**WHAT IT DOES:**

Each configured `[[link]]` pairs one CC-CC conduit (a Control Center's Bridge
Group, reached over TCP 42421 + UDP 42422/42420) with one OpenBridge
`(peer, TGID)` pair, always on DMR slot 1 (the OpenBridge convention). A call
originating on either side — CC-CC B-on/voice/B-off, or an OpenBridge DMRD
VOICE_HEAD/burst/VOICE_TERM — is translated in real time and relayed to the
other side, with no playout timer, jitter buffer, or loss concealment:
packets are translated and forwarded on arrival, and gaps present as real
gaps on the far end, not synthesized filler.

**DESIGN GOALS:**

- **Transparent translation only.** No routing, bridging, talkgroup
  rewriting, or DMR-ID lookups. Group voice in, group voice out, unchanged.
- **Single event loop, single thread.** A `poll()`-based loop multiplexes
  every CC-CC and OpenBridge socket and all timers. No threads, no locks.
- **Any number of links, any number of peers.** One shared CC-CC listener
  and voice/keepalive socket serve every configured `[[link]]`; one UDP
  socket per enabled `[[openbridge]]` peer. Strictly 1:1:1 — a CC-CC link
  and an OpenBridge `(system, TGID)` never fan out to more than each other.
  If you need N-way conference bridging spanning CC-CC, compose it by
  pointing an HBlink3 `bridge.py` confbridge at one of `cc2obp`'s OpenBridge
  legs, rather than expecting `cc2obp` itself to do fan-out.
- **One TOML config file.** See `CONFIGURING.md`.
- **No external dependencies.** The TOML parser, HMAC-SHA1, the event loop,
  and the DMR DSP/FEC code are all in this repository and compiled into the
  binary — no Python, no `pip`, no third-party libraries.
- **`enabled` / `cross_connect_active` runtime toggles, reloadable via
  SIGHUP** without a full restart — for taking a link out of service, or for
  transit-side maintenance that keeps the far Control Center from seeing
  reconnect churn while you work behind the OpenBridge leg.

**ARCHITECTURE:**

- `dmr/` — self-contained DMR DSP/FEC library (BPTC(196,96), embedded LC,
  AMBE 49↔72-bit conversion, RS(12,9), Hamming, Golay), shared with
  `ipsc2hbpc` and validated bit-for-bit against the reference `dmr_utils3`
  implementation.
- `cccc/` — the CC-CC side: link state machine (handshake, keepalive,
  link-test reflector, B-on/B-off), and the CC-CC 21-byte voice payload ⇄
  AMBE bit-packing.
- `openbridge/` — the OpenBridge side: per-peer UDP socket, HMAC-SHA1
  framing, DMRD send/receive.
- `translate.c` — wires the two sides together: the link table, per-call
  state, and both directional translation flows.
- `tests/` — a DSP self-test against golden vectors, a CC-CC AMBE
  bit-packing test, and two system tests that drive the compiled binary
  over real loopback sockets (SSRC collision; orphaned call and
  sequence/timestamp gap consistency).

**VERIFICATION:**

```
make test
```

runs all four suites — 117 checks as of this writing, 0 failures.

**WHAT IT IS NOT:**

This is not a general-purpose bridge, reflector, or conference server. It
does not do N-way bridging, talkgroup rewriting, or DMR-ID lookups. It
speaks CC-CC on one side and OpenBridge on the other, and only ever
translates one call at a time per configured link.

**REQUIREMENTS:**

- A C11 compiler and `make`
- A CC-CC-speaking remote (a c-Bridge Control Center) to link to
- An OpenBridge-speaking peer to link to — HBlink3, HBlink4, or another
  OpenBridge-capable product

**GETTING STARTED:**

```
make
cp cc2obp.toml.sample cc2obp.toml
# edit cc2obp.toml — see CONFIGURING.md
./cc2obp -c cc2obp.toml --log-level DEBUG
```

See `INSTALL.md` for the systemd service, and `CONFIGURING.md` for how to
fill in a working config, including what you'll need from the operator of
the far end of each link.

**PROPERTY:**

This work represents the author's interpretation of the CC-CC and
OpenBridge protocols. CC-CC behavior is derived from interoperability
analysis against a production c-Bridge (see
`CC-CC_Link_Protocol_Specification.md`); OpenBridge behavior is derived from
HBlink3. The DMR DSP/FEC code is shared with `ipsc2hbpc`, itself a C port of
`dmr_utils3` (N0MJS, with original AMBE work by Mike Zingman N4IRR and FEC
routines after Jonathan Naylor G4KLX).
