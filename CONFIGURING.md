# Configuring cc2obp

`cc2obp` is configured with one TOML file. Start from the sample:

```
cp cc2obp.toml.sample cc2obp.toml
```

A config has three parts: one `[global]` table (your own identity and
timers), any number of `[[openbridge]]` peers, and any number of `[[link]]`
entries tying one CC-CC conduit to exactly one OpenBridge `(peer, TGID)`.
Each `[[link]]` is self-contained — its own CC-CC identity *and* which
OpenBridge peer/TGID it cross-connects to — so a CC-CC link can never
accidentally fan out to more than one OpenBridge destination, or vice versa.

Every link involves **two other operators** you'll need to coordinate with
before it comes up: whoever runs the far end of the CC-CC conduit (a
c-Bridge Control Center), and whoever runs the OpenBridge peer (HBlink3,
HBlink4, or another OpenBridge-capable product). Neither side can be
configured from guesswork — both ends of each protocol have to agree on
specific values. This document calls those out explicitly.

## `[global]`

Identity and timers used on the CC-CC side; there's only one of this table.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `log_level` | `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, or `ERROR`. |
| `cc_site_name` | Presented as this program's site name in the CC-CC handshake. Informational only — not validated by the remote (formal spec §4.3) — but it'll show up in the far Control Center's logs, so pick something recognizable. |
| `cc_mac_address` | 12 hex characters, presented in the handshake. Appears cosmetic; any value works. |
| `cc_version`, `cc_os_version` | Free-text handshake fields. Appear cosmetic. |
| `cc_code_revision` | Free-text handshake field, presented as a build/revision number. What the c-Bridge actually *does* with this one isn't fully known — see the note below. |
| `cc_keepalive_interval` | Seconds between originated CC-CC keepalives. Leave at the default (`10`) unless you have a specific reason not to — this is the protocol's own documented cadence. |
| `cc_link_timeout` | Seconds without a received keepalive before a CC-CC link is declared dead and torn down. Should be a few multiples of `cc_keepalive_interval`. |

None of these fields are validated by the remote beyond the codec/frame-size
fields in the handshake (always `AMBE`/`60`, which `cc2obp` sends
automatically — you don't configure them) — the connection doesn't get
rejected over any of them. Nothing here needs to be coordinated with anyone;
it's purely how *you* identify yourself. That said, "not validated" isn't
the same as "confirmed inert": the c-Bridge is known to log a message
indicating it tries to match features against the `cc_code_revision` value
specifically. What that matching actually changes, if anything, isn't
known — these values were arrived at by interoperability analysis, not
vendor documentation (see the top-level `NOTICE` in `README.md`). In
practice this hasn't caused observed problems with the default sample
value, but if you hit odd behavior on a link and everything else in this
file checks out, `cc_code_revision` is one of the few remaining unknowns
worth varying.

## `[[openbridge]]` — one per remote peer

```toml
[[openbridge]]
name        = "example-peer"
enabled     = true
peer_ip     = "203.0.113.50"
peer_port   = 62031
bind_port   = 62031
network_id  = 3120000
passphrase  = "a-strong-shared-secret"
# preserve_source_peer = false   # optional; see below
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | Your own label for this peer. Referenced by `[[link]].openbridge_system`. Must be unique. |
| `enabled` | `false` means no socket is bound for this peer at all — every link referencing it goes cross-connect-inactive (§ below), without affecting those links' own CC-CC connections. |
| `peer_ip` / `peer_port` | The **remote's** address: where `cc2obp` sends OpenBridge traffic, and the source address/port every packet from that peer is checked against on receive. |
| `bind_port` | **Your own** local UDP port for this peer — independent of `peer_port`. Set it equal to `peer_port` if you want the common symmetric-port convention (as in the example above); set it to something else if this host already has something bound to that port, or you're running more than one peer and need distinct local ports. |
| `network_id` | A DMR-ID-shaped number `cc2obp` presents as its own identity in outgoing OpenBridge frames. Shows up in the remote's logs/dashboard as the originating system. |
| `preserve_source_peer` | Optional, default `false`. The DMRD "Repeater ID" field (bytes 11–14) is required by the data protocol, and OpenBridge convention says to fill it with `network_id` (this server's own ID) — that's what `false` does. But the protocol does not define how a receiver uses that field, and the reference implementation (hblink3) does not validate it: authentication is the HMAC plus the source socket, and the field is only logged/reported. Set `true` to instead forward the **originating source-peer** — the peer ID carried in the CC-CC B-on — untouched, so a call's true RF source propagates end-to-end rather than being replaced by this bridge's `network_id`. Most useful when the far OpenBridge end preserves it too. RadioID issues no IDs to infrastructure servers, so an arbitrary `network_id` propagating like a repeater ID is arguably worse than the real source-peer. |
| `passphrase` | The shared secret for this peer's HMAC-SHA1 frame signing. **Must match exactly** on both ends — OpenBridge has no other authentication. |

**Coordinate with the OpenBridge peer's operator before configuring this:**
- Their listening address and port → your `peer_ip`/`peer_port`.
- A port on your own box for them to send to → tell them this so they can
  configure it as *their* target for you; that's your `bind_port`.
- Agree on the `passphrase` out of band (not over an insecure channel — it's
  the only thing standing between "trusted peer" and "anyone who can guess
  it"; OpenBridge itself provides no other security, see
  `CC-CC_Link_Protocol_Specification.md`'s security considerations section
  for the CC-CC side's equivalent caveat).
- Tell them your `network_id`, and ask if they need to add anything on
  their end (an ACL entry, a bridge rule) referencing it or the TGID you'll
  be using — see the `[[link]].tgid` note below.

If two enabled peers would need to bind the same local port, `cc2obp`
refuses to start with a clear error rather than a bare "address in use" —
give them distinct `bind_port` values.

## `[[link]]` — one per CC-CC conduit

```toml
[[link]]
name                 = "example-link"
enabled              = true
cross_connect_active = true
tgid                 = 9
openbridge_system    = "example-peer"
cc_role              = "outbound"
cc_lid               = 69
cc_remote_ip         = "203.0.113.18"
cc_remote_port       = 42421
cc_remote_voice_port = 42422
cc_channel_name      = "MYBRIDGE-9"
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | Your own label. Must be unique across all links. |
| `enabled` | `false`: no TCP attempt (outbound) or acceptance (inbound); no handshake, no keepalives. The conduit is entirely dark. |
| `cross_connect_active` | `false`: the CC-CC connection stays up — handshake, keepalives, link-test all continue, so the far Control Center sees a healthy link with no reconnect churn — but call traffic is dropped in both directions. Use this for transit-side maintenance; use `enabled = false` to decommission the link entirely. |
| `tgid` | The OpenBridge-side TGID this link maps to. **Local to the OpenBridge conversation with this peer** — it is *not* carried over the CC-CC side at all (CC-CC routes by LID, not TGID; formal spec §5) and does not need to match any number the far Control Center uses internally. It *does* need to match whatever TGID the OpenBridge peer operator expects traffic on for this bridge (see below). |
| `openbridge_system` | References an `[[openbridge]].name`. |
| `cc_role` | `"outbound"`: `cc2obp` dials out to the far Control Center. `"inbound"`: `cc2obp` listens (on the shared TCP 42421) and waits for the far end to dial in. |
| `cc_lid` | The CC-CC Link ID. **Must match what the far Control Center's own bridge configuration expects for this conduit** — this is the actual routing key on the wire (formal spec §5, §7). Two digits on the wire; per the formal spec, encoding for values over 99 is undefined, so stay at or below 99 until that's resolved upstream. |
| `cc_remote_ip` | Required for **both** roles. Outbound: the address dialed. Inbound: the expected/pinned source address of the far end — required to disambiguate incoming connections once more than one remote might connect (see `(cc_remote_ip, cc_lid)` uniqueness below). |
| `cc_remote_port` | **Outbound only** — the far end's TCP control port (normally `42421`). Omit for inbound links; an inbound link never dials out, so it has no use for the remote's control port. |
| `cc_remote_voice_port` | The far end's UDP voice/keepalive port (normally `42422`), both roles. |
| `cc_channel_name` | **Outbound only** — sent as the Bridge Group / channel name in the handshake. Informational, not validated, but should be recognizable to whoever's reading logs on the far end. |

**Coordinate with the far Control Center's operator before configuring
this:**
- Agree on the **`cc_lid`** value — both ends must use the same number; it's
  how the far c-Bridge routes the conduit to the right Bridge Group.
- Agree on **which end dials out**. Whichever end is `outbound` needs the
  other's reachable IP and control port; whichever end is `inbound` needs
  to know the outbound end's source IP ahead of time (that's your
  `cc_remote_ip`, even on the inbound side — it's used to validate the
  incoming connection, not just to dial one).
- Confirm their side is actually configured to bridge this LID into the
  Bridge Group / IPSC LID they intend — that's entirely their own local
  configuration and outside `cc2obp`'s visibility.
- The far end doesn't need to know your `tgid` — that number is purely
  between `cc2obp` and the OpenBridge peer (see above), never carried over
  CC-CC.

### Validation

`cc2obp` refuses to start (with a specific error, not a crash) on any of:

- Duplicate `[[link]].name`, or duplicate `[[openbridge]].name`.
- Duplicate `(openbridge_system, tgid)` across links — that pair is the
  OpenBridge-side routing key and must be unique.
- Duplicate `(cc_remote_ip, cc_lid)` among **inbound** links — that pair is
  how an incoming connection gets matched to a configured link.
- A missing `cc_remote_ip`, or an `openbridge_system` that doesn't reference
  a configured peer.
- Two enabled `[[openbridge]]` peers sharing a `bind_port`.

A duplicate `(cc_remote_ip, cc_remote_port, cc_lid)` across **outbound**
links is logged as a likely typo but does not block startup — each outbound
link gets its own dedicated connection regardless, so it isn't a
correctness problem, just probably not what you meant.

## Multiple links, multiple peers

Nothing about the config format limits you to one of each — add as many
`[[openbridge]]` and `[[link]]` blocks as you need. Two links can share one
`[[openbridge]]` peer (different TGIDs); two links can each reference a
different peer entirely. Each conduit is independent — traffic on one link
never crosses into another.

What you cannot do is point two links at the same OpenBridge `(peer, tgid)`,
or have one CC-CC link cross-connect to more than one OpenBridge
destination — that's full N-way conference bridging, a different problem
`cc2obp` deliberately doesn't solve (see the README). If you need that,
compose it by pointing an HBlink3/HBlink4 `bridge.py`-style confbridge at
one of `cc2obp`'s OpenBridge legs.

## Reloading toggles

`enabled` and `cross_connect_active` (on both `[[link]]` and
`[[openbridge]]`) can be changed and picked up with `systemctl reload
cc2obp` (or `kill -HUP`) — see `INSTALL.md`. Any other field change in the
file is logged at WARNING and ignored until a full restart.

## Testing your config

Before reloading or restarting a running instance, validate the file on its
own — this never binds a socket, so it can't conflict with an instance
that's already using the same ports:

```
./cc2obp -c cc2obp.toml --check
```

On success this prints every configured peer and link (name, enabled/
cross_connect_active state, role, TGID, LID) so you can eyeball that the
edit did what you meant; on failure it prints every problem found, in the
same form `config_load` always produces (see "Validation" above), and
exits 1 without printing a summary.

To actually run it and watch it try to come up:

```
./cc2obp -c cc2obp.toml --log-level DEBUG
```

Watch the log for `link 'NAME': UP` on the CC-CC side and
`openbridge peer 'NAME' socket up` on the OpenBridge side. `--wire`
restricts output to raw hex dumps of what's actually on the wire, useful
when working with the far operator to debug a handshake that isn't coming
up.
